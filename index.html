    <h1>Choosing your web development IDE</h1>
    <p>Of course it all about personal preference. It is also about the circumtances of which you are in. Maybe your workplace
      aready has a workflow with their set up decided. Anyway my personal favorites are Atom, webstorm and sublime. But my
      latest discovery and new favoritr is Visual studio Code. If you are familiar with Microsoft visual studio,you'll find
      yoursef right at home. Give it a try, and you will have a hard time going back!</p>



    <h1 id="Atom">Atom</h1>
    <p>Has been my lovely companion for many years, and still one of my most used applications. Ease of use, and lots of pibities
      to expand</p>

    <h1 id="Sublime">Sublime</h1>
    <p>Never really got it o work for me. But many developers use it, and swear it is one of the best</p>



    <h1 id="VSC">Visual Studio Code</h1>
    <p>Man, what a surprise. Thought it would be a heavy, slow and boring IDE. Boy was I wrong. Love this one</p>
